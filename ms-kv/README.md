# Challenge #6a: Single-Node, Totally-Available Transactions

In this challenge, youâ€™ll need to implement a key/value store which implements transactions. These transactions contain micro-operations (read & write) and the results of those operations depends on the consistency guarantees of the challenge. Your goal is to support weak consistency while also being totally available. We begin with a single-node service and then write a multi-node version.
