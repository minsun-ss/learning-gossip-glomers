# Challenge #4: Grow-Only Counter

In this challenge, you’ll need to implement a stateless, grow-only counter which will run against Maelstrom’s g-counter workload. This challenge is different than before in that your nodes will rely on a sequentially-consistent key/value store service provided by Maelstrom.
