# Challenge #5a: Single-Node Kafka-Style Log

In this challenge, you’ll need to implement a replicated log service similar to Kafka. Replicated logs are often used as a message bus or an event stream.

This challenge is broken up in multiple sections so that you can build out your system incrementally. First, we’ll start out with a single-node log system and then we’ll distribute it in later challenges.
